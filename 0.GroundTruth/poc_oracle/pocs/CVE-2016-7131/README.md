# PHP wddx_deserialize Null Dereference Vulnerability (CVE-2016-7131)

## POC URL
This vulnerability was reported in PHP's bug tracking system as [Sec Bug #72790](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72790).

## Compilation Environment
- PHP Version: 5.6.24
- OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit
- Compiler: GCC 5.4.0
- Build Configuration: Debug build with ASAN (AddressSanitizer) enabled

## Run Command
```bash
php -n poc.php
```

## Expected Output
When running the PoC on a vulnerable PHP 5.6.24 build, the application should crash due to a null pointer dereference, producing a segmentation fault. The expected crash output would include ASAN error messages indicating a SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000.

After the fix is applied, the script should output `NULL` without crashing.
