# TensorFlow tf.raw_ops.Switch Segfault PoC

This is a proof-of-concept demonstrating a segmentation fault vulnerability in TensorFlow's `tf.raw_ops.Switch` operation when running in eager mode.

## POC URL
Original advisory: [GHSA-4g9f-63rx-5cw4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-4g9f-63rx-5cw4)

## Compilation Environment
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow versions < 2.3.0 (vulnerable versions)

## Run Command
```
python poc.py
```

## Expected Output
On vulnerable TensorFlow versions (< 2.3.0), this will cause a segmentation fault when running in eager mode. On patched versions (1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, 2.3.1 or later), the operation will complete without crashing.

Note: The segfault occurs because the eager runtime attempts to access a null pointer when processing the undefined output tensor from the Switch operation.
