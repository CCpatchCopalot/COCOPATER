# Segmentation Fault in changedline (Lua 5.4.0)

## POC URL
Original report: [Lua mailing list archive](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2020-07/msg00123.html)

## Compilation Environment
- Lua version: 5.4.0 (git hash 31b8c2d4380a762d1ed6a7faee74a1d107f86014)
- Tested on: Default build of Lua on Ubuntu 18.04
- Note: The error disappears when built with ASAN (Address Sanitizer)

## Run Command
1. Save the POC code to a file (e.g., `segfault.lua`)
2. Run with Lua 5.4.0:
```bash
lua segfault.lua
```

## Expected Output
The program should crash with a segmentation fault, with the following partial stack trace:
```
#0 0x00000000004248b3 in changedline (newpc=0x5, oldpc=0xffffe4b5, p=0xf84380) at ldebug.c:791
#1 luaG_traceexec (L=0xf846b8, pc=0xf86d08) at ldebug.c:826
#2 0x00000000004923f5 in luaV_execute (L=L@entry=0xf846b8, ci=<optimized out>) at lvm.c:1725
#3 0x000000000042e792 in luaD_call (L=L@entry=0xf846b8, func=<optimized out>, nresults=<optimized out>) at ldo.c:504
#4 0x00000000004973ab in luaV_execute (L=L@entry=0xf846b8, ci=<optimized out>) at lvm.c:1614
```

The crash occurs in the `changedline` function called by `luaG_traceexec` during execution tracing.
