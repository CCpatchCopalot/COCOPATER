# Proof of Concept for CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities

## POC URL
This proof-of-concept demonstrates multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of CGAL libcgal (CGAL-5.1.1). The vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco Talos advisory TALOS-2020-1225.

## Compilation Environment
To reproduce these vulnerabilities, you will need:
- CGAL libcgal version 5.1.1
- A system with AddressSanitizer (ASAN) support for crash detection
- A program that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the provided POC code as a file with `.nef3` extension
2. Run a CGAL-based application that processes Nef polygon files with the malicious file as input
3. Alternatively, use the following command with a test harness:
```
./cgaltest input_file.nef3
```

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds memory access when processing the malformed Nef polygon file. With AddressSanitizer enabled, you should see detailed crash information showing the invalid memory access.
