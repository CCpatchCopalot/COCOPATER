# CGAL libcgal Nef polygon-parsing vulnerabilities PoC

## POC URL
This proof-of-concept demonstrates multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of CGAL libcgal (CGAL-5.1.1). The vulnerabilities can lead to type confusion and potential code execution when processing specially crafted malformed files.

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version 5.1.1
- A system with CGAL installed and configured
- A vulnerable application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the provided PoC code as a file with `.nef3` extension
2. Run any application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality to process this file

## Expected Output
The vulnerable application should crash due to out-of-bounds memory access when processing the malformed Nef polygon file. The exact crash behavior may vary depending on the specific vulnerability triggered and the application's memory layout.

Note: This PoC demonstrates the vulnerability pattern rather than targeting a specific crash vector. Multiple similar vulnerabilities exist in the Nef polygon parsing code as documented in the advisory.
