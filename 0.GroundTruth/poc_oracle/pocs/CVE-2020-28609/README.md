# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version CGAL-5.1.1
- A vulnerable application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the POC code as `exploit.nef3`
2. Run the vulnerable application that processes Nef polygon files with the malicious file:
```
vulnerable_app exploit.nef3
```

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion vulnerabilities when processing the malformed Nef polygon file. The crash may lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the application's memory layout and security mitigations.

## Vulnerabilities
This POC demonstrates multiple OOB read vulnerabilities in CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality (CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636). The malformed file contains specially crafted indices that trigger out-of-bounds reads in various vector accesses during the parsing process.
