# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
This vulnerability was disclosed by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group in their advisory TALOS-2020-1225. The full advisory can be found at:
https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version CGAL-5.1.1
- A vulnerable application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the provided POC code as a `.nef3` file (e.g., `exploit.nef3`)
2. Run the vulnerable application that processes Nef polygon files with the malicious file:
```
vulnerable_app exploit.nef3
```

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion vulnerabilities in the Nef polygon parsing functionality. The specific crash behavior will depend on which vulnerability is triggered, but may include:
- Segmentation faults
- Memory access violations
- Potential arbitrary code execution

Note: The provided POC demonstrates the vulnerability by using malformed indices that trigger out-of-bounds reads. Actual exploitation may require further refinement to achieve reliable code execution.
