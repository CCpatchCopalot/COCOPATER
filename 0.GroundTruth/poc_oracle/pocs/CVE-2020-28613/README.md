# CGAL libcgal Nef polygon-parsing vulnerabilities PoC

## POC URL
This proof-of-concept demonstrates multiple code execution vulnerabilities in the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of CGAL libcgal (CGAL-5.1.1). The vulnerabilities allow for out-of-bounds reads and type confusion through specially crafted malformed files.

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version 5.1.1
- A system with CGAL installed and configured

## Run Command
1. Save the provided PoC code as a `.nef3` file (e.g., `exploit.nef3`)
2. Run any CGAL application that processes Nef polygon files with the malicious file as input:
   ```
   ./cgal_application exploit.nef3
   ```

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds memory access or type confusion, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The exact behavior will depend on the specific vulnerability triggered by the malformed input.

## Vulnerabilities Demonstrated
This PoC demonstrates multiple CVEs (CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636 and CVE-2020-35628 through CVE-2020-35636) related to out-of-bounds reads in various Nef polygon parsing functions.
