# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version CGAL-5.1.1
- Vulnerable components: Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the provided proof-of-concept code as `exploit.nef3`
2. Use any application that processes Nef polygon files with CGAL libcgal (e.g., OpenSCAD)
3. Load the `exploit.nef3` file in the vulnerable application

## Expected Output
The vulnerable application should crash due to out-of-bounds memory access when parsing the malformed Nef polygon file. The crash occurs because the parser fails to validate array indices before using them to access various object vectors (Edge_of, Vertex_of, SFace_of, etc.), leading to memory corruption.

Multiple CVEs are associated with this vulnerability (CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636 and CVE-2020-35628 through CVE-2020-35636), each representing different out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the Nef polygon parsing functionality.
