# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version CGAL-5.1.1
- A vulnerable application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the POC code as a file with `.nef3` extension (e.g., `exploit.nef3`)
2. Run the vulnerable application that processes Nef polygon files with this file as input

## Expected Output
The vulnerable application should crash or exhibit unexpected behavior due to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion vulnerabilities in the Nef polygon parsing functionality. The specific behavior may vary depending on the application and the vulnerability being triggered.

## Notes
This POC demonstrates multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636) in CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality. The vulnerabilities allow for arbitrary memory reads which can lead to type confusion and potentially code execution.
