# CGAL libcgal Nef polygon-parsing vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version CGAL-5.1.1
- Vulnerable components: Nef_2/PM_io_parser.h, Nef_S2/SM_io_parser.h, Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h

## Run Command
1. Compile an application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality
2. Load the provided malformed .nef3 file

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion vulnerabilities when parsing the malformed Nef polygon file. The crash demonstrates multiple code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636) in the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of CGAL libcgal.

## Vulnerabilities
This proof-of-concept triggers multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in CGAL's Nef polygon parsing code, which could lead to type confusion and potentially code execution. The vulnerabilities exist when parsing specially crafted malformed Nef polygon files without proper bounds checking on array indices.
