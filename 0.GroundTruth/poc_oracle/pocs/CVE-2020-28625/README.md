# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
This vulnerability was disclosed by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group in their advisory TALOS-2020-1225. The full advisory can be found at: [https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225](https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225)

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version CGAL-5.1.1
- A vulnerable application that parses Nef polygon files using CGAL

## Run Command
1. Save the provided proof-of-concept code as a `.nef3` file
2. Run the vulnerable application that processes Nef polygon files with the malicious file as input

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion vulnerabilities when processing the malformed Nef polygon file. The crash demonstrates the potential for arbitrary code execution through memory corruption.

Note: The exact crash behavior may vary depending on the specific application using CGAL and the operating environment.
