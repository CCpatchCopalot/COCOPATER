# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version CGAL-5.1.1
- A system with CGAL installed and configured

## Run Command
1. Save the POC code to a file named `exploit.nef3`
2. Use a vulnerable application that parses NEF3 files with CGAL (e.g., OpenSCAD)
3. Load the `exploit.nef3` file in the vulnerable application

## Expected Output
The vulnerable application should crash due to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion vulnerabilities in the Nef polygon parsing functionality. In some cases, this could lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Vulnerabilities
This POC demonstrates multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality, including:
- CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636
- CVE-2020-35628 through CVE-2020-35636

These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to craft malicious NEF3 files that can cause memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when processed by vulnerable applications.
