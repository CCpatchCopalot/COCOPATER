# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities

## POC URL
This proof-of-concept demonstrates multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in CGAL libcgal's Nef polygon parsing functionality (CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636).

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version 5.1.1
- A vulnerable application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the POC code as a `.nef3` file
2. Load the file in an application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds memory access when parsing the malformed Nef polygon file. The crash occurs because the parser fails to validate array indices before using them to access vectors, leading to type confusion and potential code execution.
