# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities POC

## POC URL
This proof-of-concept demonstrates multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of CGAL libcgal (CGAL-5.1.1). The vulnerabilities can lead to type confusion and potential code execution when processing specially crafted malformed Nef polygon files.

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version 5.1.1
- A system with CGAL installed and configured
- A vulnerable application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the POC code to a file (e.g., `poc.nef3`)
2. Run the vulnerable application that processes Nef polygon files with the malicious file as input:
   ```
   vulnerable_app poc.nef3
   ```

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds memory access when processing the malformed Nef polygon file. The crash demonstrates the vulnerability by triggering one of the many possible out-of-bounds read conditions in the Nef polygon parsing code.

Note: The exact crash behavior may vary depending on the specific application using CGAL and the system configuration.
