# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version CGAL-5.1.1
- Vulnerable components in Nef_2, Nef_3, and Nef_S2 modules

## Run Command
1. Save the POC code as `exploit.nef3`
2. Use any application that imports Nef polygon files with CGAL (e.g., OpenSCAD)
3. Import the malicious file:
   ```
   openscad exploit.nef3
   ```

## Expected Output
- The application will crash due to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion vulnerabilities
- Depending on the specific vulnerability triggered, may lead to arbitrary code execution
- Multiple CVEs are affected (CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636, CVE-2020-35628 through CVE-2020-35636)

Note: This vulnerability affects the parsing of Nef polygon files in CGAL, allowing an attacker to craft malicious files that can lead to memory corruption and potentially code execution when processed by applications using vulnerable versions of CGAL.
