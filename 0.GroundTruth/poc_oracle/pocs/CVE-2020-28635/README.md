# Proof of Concept for CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities

## POC URL
This proof-of-concept demonstrates multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of CGAL libcgal version 5.1.1.

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version 5.1.1
- A system with CGAL installed and configured
- A vulnerable application that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the provided POC code as a file with `.nef3` extension (e.g., `exploit.nef3`)
2. Use a vulnerable application that parses Nef polygon files (e.g., OpenSCAD)
3. Load the malicious file in the vulnerable application:
   ```
   openscad exploit.nef3
   ```

## Expected Output
The vulnerable application should crash due to out-of-bounds memory access when parsing the specially crafted Nef polygon file. The crash occurs because the parser doesn't properly validate array indices before using them to access vectors, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.
