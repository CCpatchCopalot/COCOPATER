# CGAL libcgal Multiple Code Execution Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version CGAL-5.1.1
- Vulnerable component: Nef polygon-parsing functionality

## Run Command
1. Save the POC code as a `.nef3` file (e.g., `exploit.nef3`)
2. Use any application that processes Nef polygon files with the vulnerable CGAL version
3. Load the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion vulnerabilities when processing the malformed Nef polygon file. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the context in which CGAL is used.

## Vulnerabilities
This POC demonstrates multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality, including:
- CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636
- CVE-2020-35628 through CVE-2020-35636

These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to craft a malicious Nef polygon file that can cause memory corruption and potentially lead to remote code execution when processed by vulnerable applications.
