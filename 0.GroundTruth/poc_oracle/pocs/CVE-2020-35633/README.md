# CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2020-1225)

## POC URL
https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1225

## Compilation Environment
- CGAL libcgal version 5.1.1
- Any system with vulnerable CGAL installation

## Run Command
1. Save the proof-of-concept to a file named `exploit.nef3`
2. Run any CGAL application that processes Nef polygon files with the malicious file:
```
your_cgal_application exploit.nef3
```

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds read or type confusion vulnerabilities when processing the malformed Nef polygon file. The crash may lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the specific vulnerability triggered.

## Vulnerabilities
This proof-of-concept demonstrates multiple vulnerabilities in CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality, including:
- Out-of-bounds reads in various parsing functions
- Type confusion issues
- Multiple CVEs: CVE-2020-28601 through CVE-2020-28636, CVE-2020-35628 through CVE-2020-35636

Note: The exact behavior may vary depending on which specific vulnerability is triggered by the malformed input.
