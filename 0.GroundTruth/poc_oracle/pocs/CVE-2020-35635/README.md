# Proof of Concept for CGAL libcgal Nef Polygon Parsing Vulnerabilities

## POC URL
This proof-of-concept demonstrates multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the CGAL libcgal library (version 5.1.1) when parsing Nef polygon files. The vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco Talos advisory TALOS-2020-1225.

## Compilation Environment
To reproduce these vulnerabilities, you will need:
- CGAL libcgal version 5.1.1
- A program that uses CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality
- A system with memory protection mechanisms disabled (for easier demonstration of the vulnerabilities)

## Run Command
1. Save the provided proof-of-concept code as a file with `.nef3` extension
2. Use a CGAL-based application to load/parse this file
3. Observe the out-of-bounds read behavior

Example command (if using a vulnerable CGAL-based application):
```
./vulnerable_app poc.nef3
```

## Expected Output
The application should crash due to out-of-bounds memory access when attempting to parse the malformed Nef polygon file. The crash will demonstrate one of the many possible out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities documented in the advisory.

Note: The exact crash behavior may vary depending on:
- Which specific vulnerability is triggered first
- The memory layout of the target system
- Compiler protections in place
- The specific CGAL-based application being used
