# JavaScript Disabled Bypass POC

## POC URL
N/A (Client-side JavaScript execution)

## Compilation Environment
- Any modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

## Run Command
1. Copy the following JavaScript code: `javascript:alert('XSS')`
2. Paste it into your browser's address bar
3. Press Enter to execute

## Expected Output
- An alert popup will appear with the message 'XSS'
- This demonstrates that JavaScript execution is possible despite the 'JavaScript disabled' message

Note: This is a simple proof-of-concept showing that the JavaScript disabled message can be bypassed by directly executing JavaScript in the browser's address bar.
