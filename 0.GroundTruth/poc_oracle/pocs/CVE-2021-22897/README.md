# JavaScript Enabled Proof of Concept

## POC URL
This is a client-side proof of concept that can be executed in any browser's address bar after the `javascript:` protocol.

## Compilation Environment
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript must be enabled in the browser

## Run Command
1. Copy the following code: `javascript:alert('JavaScript is enabled!');`
2. Paste it into your browser's address bar
3. Press Enter to execute

## Expected Output
- A browser alert popup will appear with the message "JavaScript is enabled!"
- This demonstrates that JavaScript execution is working in the browser
- If you don't see the alert, check your browser's JavaScript settings
