# HEVC Integer Overflow Vulnerability Reproduction

## POC URL
https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/1721

## Compilation Environment
- GPAC version with vulnerable code (prior to fix)
- Linux/Unix environment
- GDB for debugging (optional)

## Run Command
```
gpac -info bug4
```

## Expected Output
1. The application will crash due to an integer overflow in the `hevc_parse_slice_segment` function
2. The crash occurs when a negative `pps_id` value is processed, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access
3. In GDB, you should see a segmentation fault when the application tries to access invalid memory
