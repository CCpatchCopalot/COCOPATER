# Heap Overflow in gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal

## POC URL
https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/1722

## Compilation Environment
- GPAC version: Latest from GitHub (as of March 2021)
- Operating System: Any supported by GPAC
- Compiler: Any C compiler supported by GPAC

## Run Command
```
gpac -info bug5
```

## Expected Output
When running the command with the crafted file (bug5), GPAC will crash due to a heap overflow vulnerability in the `gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal` function. The crash occurs because the crafted file causes `pps->num_tile_columns` to be larger than the size of `pps->column_width`, leading to an out-of-bounds write in the heap memory.

For debugging purposes, you can run the command under GDB to observe the heap overflow and crash details.
