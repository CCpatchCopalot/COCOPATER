# Integer Overflow in gf_avc_read_pps_bs_internal

## POC URL
https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/1720

## Compilation Environment
- GPAC version: Latest (as of March 2021)
- Operating System: Any supported by GPAC
- Compiler: Any standard C compiler

## Run Command
```
gpac -info bug3
```

## Expected Output
1. The application will crash due to an integer overflow when processing the malformed input file
2. The crash occurs because a negative `pps_id` value bypasses the validation check but causes an out-of-bounds array access
3. In some cases, this may lead to arbitrary memory writes due to the subsequent assignment `pps->id = pps_id`

## Notes
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted AVC video file
- The issue occurs in `media_tools/av_parsers.c` in function `gf_avc_read_pps_bs_internal`
- The root cause is insufficient validation of the `pps_id` value read from the input file
