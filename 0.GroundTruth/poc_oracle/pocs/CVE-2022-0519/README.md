## Compilation Environment
### build the radare2 with address sanitizer
export CFLAGS=" -fsanitize=address "; export CXXFLAGS=" -fsanitize=address "; export LDFLAGS=" -fsanitize=address ";
CFGARG=" --enable-shared=no " PREFIX=`realpath install` bash sys/build.sh
### disable some features of address sanitizer to avoid false positives
export ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:abort_on_error=1:symbolize=0:allocator_may_return_null=1:detect_odr_violation=0

# trigger the crash
./radare2 -A -q POC_FILE
## Run Command
N/A - No exploit code was generated as no vulnerability details were provided.

## Expected Output
N/A - No vulnerability details were provided to determine expected output.

Note: The input appears to be a generic website footer for huntr.dev (a bug bounty platform for AI/ML systems) rather than a vulnerability proof-of-concept.
