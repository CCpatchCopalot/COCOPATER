# NULL Pointer Dereference in gf_isom_parse_movie_boxes_internal

## POC URL
https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/2163

## Compilation Environment
- GPAC version: 2.1-DEV-rev87-g053aae8-master
- Configuration: `--prefix=/path_to_gpac/build --enable-debug --enable-sanitizer`
- Features: GPAC_CONFIG_LINUX, GPAC_64_BITS, GPAC_HAS_IPV6, GPAC_HAS_SSL, etc.

## Run Command
```
MP4Box -hint -out /dev/null poc
```

## Expected Output
```
[iso file] Read Box type 00000000 (0x00000000) at position 45 has size 0 but is not at root/file level. Forbidden, skipping end of parent box !
[iso file] Read Box "abst" (start 0) failed (Unknown Error (10)) - skipping
isomedia/isom_intern.c:392:12: runtime error: member access within null pointer of type 'struct GF_Box'
```

## Description
When processing a malformed MP4 file with a box size of 0 that's not at root/file level, the parser returns GF_SKIP_BOX (10) and sets the box pointer to NULL. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when trying to access the box type later in the parsing process.
