# Tesseract Division by Zero Vulnerability POC

## POC URL
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/3498

## Compilation Environment
- Ubuntu 20.04.2 64bit
- Tesseract version: 5.0.0-alpha-20210401
- Leptonica version: 1.79.0

## Run Command
1. Download the vulnerable image file from the issue
2. Run Tesseract OCR on the image:
```
tesseract poc_image.png output
```

## Expected Output
The program should crash with a SIGFPE (Arithmetic exception) due to division by zero in the Leptonica library's `pixBlockconvGray()` function.

## Notes
This vulnerability occurs during image processing when Tesseract attempts to perform block convolution on an image that triggers a division by zero condition in the Leptonica library.
