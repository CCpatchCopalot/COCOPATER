# JavaScript Enabled Proof of Concept

## POC URL
This is a local HTML file that demonstrates JavaScript execution. No external URL is required.

## Summary:
A server can send an HTTP response with many occurrences of Transfer-Encoding and/or Content-Encoding headers. Each listed encoding allocates a buffer. The number of encodings listed within each header is already bounded but the number of headers is not, allowing an HTTP response to consume all available memory.
## Steps To Reproduce:
Using the curl test environment:
Extract test418 from the attached patch
runtests.pl 418

## Supporting Material/References:
Patch fixing the problem and new test for the case.
Impact
Denial of service.
