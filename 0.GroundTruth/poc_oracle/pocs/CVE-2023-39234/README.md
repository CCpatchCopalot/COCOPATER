# GTKWave VZT vzt_rd_process_block autosort Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability (TALOS-2023-1817)

## POC URL
This vulnerability was disclosed by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group:
https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2023-1817

## Compilation Environment
- GTKWave version 3.3.115 (vulnerable version)
- Tested on Linux (but affects all platforms)

## Run Command
1. Generate the malicious VZT file:
```
python3 poc.py malicious.vzt
```

2. Open the malicious file with GTKWave:
```
gtkwave malicious.vzt
```

Or convert it using the command line tool:
```
vzt2vcd malicious.vzt
```

## Expected Output
- The vulnerable GTKWave version will crash due to an out-of-bounds write
- With careful heap manipulation, this could lead to arbitrary code execution
- The vulnerability occurs when processing specially crafted VZT files that trigger improper validation in the autosort functionality
