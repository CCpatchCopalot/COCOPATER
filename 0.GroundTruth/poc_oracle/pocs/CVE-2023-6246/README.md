# CVE-2023-6246: Heap-based buffer overflow in glibc's syslog()

## POC URL
Original advisory: https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/30/1

## Compilation Environment
- Vulnerable systems:
  - Debian 12 and 13
  - Ubuntu 23.04 and 23.10
  - Fedora 37 to 39
  - Other distributions using glibc 2.36 or 2.37

## Run Command
1. Save the PoC script as `cve-2023-6246-poc.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x cve-2023-6246-poc.sh`
3. Execute it: `./cve-2023-6246-poc.sh`

Note: The exploit may need to be run multiple times (10,000s of attempts) to succeed due to heap layout randomization.

## Expected Output
If successful, the exploit will:
1. Create directories and a malicious library in the current working directory
2. Trigger the buffer overflow in glibc's syslog() function
3. Load the malicious library with root privileges
4. Execute arbitrary commands as root (in this PoC, writing the current user ID to `/tmp/pwned`)

Successful exploitation will result in privilege escalation from an unprivileged user to root.
