**Result.** To demonstrate the generality of CoCoPATER in real-world scenarios, we constructed a new dataset containing both tangled patches and CC patches. The results is in [RQ3 results](https://github.com/CCpatchCopalot/COCOPATER/tree/main/RQ3.Generality/results.json).

- the raw results of `CoCoPATER` is shown in [results_cocopater](https://github.com/CCpatchCopalot/COCOPATER/tree/main/RQ3.Generality/results_cocopater)
- The raw results of `PRIMEVUL` is shown in [results_primevul](https://github.com/CCpatchCopalot/COCOPATER/tree/main/RQ3.Generality/results_primevul)
- the raw results of `PRIMEVUL++` is shown in [results_privevul++](https://github.com/CCpatchCopalot/COCOPATER/tree/main/RQ3.Generality/results_privevul++)
- the raw results of `SmartCommit` is shown in [results_SmartCommit](https://github.com/CCpatchCopalot/COCOPATER/tree/main/RQ3.Generality/results_SmartCommit)
- the raw results of `DiffCat` is shown in [results_diffcat](https://github.com/CCpatchCopalot/COCOPATER/tree/main/RQ3.Generality/results_diffcat)

To get the results of the baselines on the generality dataset, follow the similiar step of RQ1.
